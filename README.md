# Weather-API

This project was a quick one that will ask the user for a zipcode and give back the current weather forcast. 

The User will have to sign up for an account with developer.accuweather.com. This will get you your api key which you will have to input on the correct line of code to get the program calls to work correctly. 

The code will out put current weather, temperature, wind speed and direction, wind gust speed, humidity, percipitation probabilities for rain, snow, and ice, total percipitation for rain, snow and ice, and visibility.
